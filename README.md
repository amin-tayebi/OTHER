In "import context" in ttn there is an error, to solve the belo errors in pythone code:

- Module context not found

While installing package with (pip install context) you will see this error:
- ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement context.viewer (from context) (from versions: none)
ERROR: No matching distribution found for context.viewer

In the terminal type:
1) source /home/genius/PycharmProjects/pythonProject1/venv/bin/activate
2) Run your python script here (in venv) 


If not worked create a new project and directory and then do the above steps. No need to install context package.
